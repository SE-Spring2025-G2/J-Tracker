# INSTALLATION GUIDE

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended >= 3.8)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Latest version 21.3 used as of 11/3)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Latest version 6.14.4 used as of 11/3)
- [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Latest version as of 11/27)

## Setting Up a Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Start the Docker Engine**
    - Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Docker website.
    - Start the Docker engine on your machine. The command varies based on your operating system.

3. **Build Images**
    - Navigate to the backend folder and build the image for the API using the following command:
        ```
        docker build -f dockerfile.api -t ats-api .
        ```
    - Similarly, navigate to the frontend folder and build the image for the client using the following command:
        ```
        docker build -f dockerfile.client -t ats-client .
        ```

4. **Run Docker Compose**
    - Finally, run the following command to start the application:
        ```
        docker-compose up
        ```

5. **Ensure Both are Running**

   - Use **separate terminal windows** for frontend and backend services.
   - The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (unless configured otherwise).
   - The backend will run at the specified port in your project configuration.

## Hosting the Database:

### Local MongoDB:

1. Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Follow the [Installion Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)
3. In app.py set 'host' string to 'localhost'
4. Run the local database:

mongodb

- Recommended: Use a GUI such as [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/) to more easily interact with the database

### Hosted database with MongoDB Atlas: 

1. [Create account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register) for MongoDB

- **If current MongoDB Atlas owner adds your username/password to the cluster, skip to step 4** \*

2. Follow MongoDB Atlas [Setup Guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) to create a database collection for hosting applications
3. Create application.yml in the backend folder with the following content:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID : <Oauth Google ID>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET : <Oauth Google Secret>
   CONF_URL : https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
   SECRET_KEY : <Any Secret You Want>
   USERNAME : <MongoDB Atlas Username>
   PASSWORD : <MongoDB Atlas Password>
   CLUSTER_URL : <MongoDB Cluster URL>
   ```
4. In app.py set 'host' string to your MongoDB Atlas connection string. Replace the username and password with {username} and {password} respectively
5. For testing through CI to function as expected, repository secrets will need to be added through the settings. Create individual secrets with the following keys/values:

MONGO_USER: <MongoDB Atlas cluster username>
MONGO_PASS: <MongoDB Atlas cluster password>
